SuperLayout
===========

SuperLayout is a library that adds a few custom operators to Swift that makes using the amazing (and...perhaps verbose :) ) NSLayoutAnchor API introduced in iOS 9 a breeze. Unlike other libraries, it doesn't override already-defined methods in `Equatable` (such as `==` and `>=`), and defines ones that are logical and easily understandable to anyone who might be inheriting your codebase or joining your team.

What It Does
------------

In short, SuperLayout turns this:

<img src='old1.png' width='589px' />

Into this:

<img src='new1.png' width='355px' />

How it works
------------

SuperLayout defines just three custom operators: `~`, `≥`, and `≤`. `~` roughly corresponds to `equalTo`, `≥` to `greaterThanOrEqualTo`, and `≤` to `lessThanOrEqualTo`. The greater than and less than operators were chosen with practicality in mind; `≥` and `≤` have simple keyboard shortcuts (just `Option` + `<` and `Option` + `>` in Xcode), so there's no need to copy-paste characters when writing constraints.

You might be wondering: why create new operators instead of using `==`, `<=`, and `>=`?

I have an easy answer: those operators already have meaning, and don't have assignment semantics. You would never write `1 == 2` with the expectation that it would return anything other than a `Bool` indicating equality.

Installation
------------

SuperLayout is available via CocoaPods and SwiftPM. If you're using CocoaPods, just specify this in your Podfile:

    pod 'SuperLayout', '~> 0.2'

### Before You Use

To use this library, you should have a basic understanding of the [`NSLayoutAnchor` API](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/nslayoutanchor). If not, read up, and then check out the documentation below to get started.

## NSLayoutConstraint Reference

Note: SuperLayout does not (yet) automatically turn off `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` for the views you'd like to manage with Auto Layout. Disabling this setting automatically is too magical for me. Feel free to create an issue if you disagree.
